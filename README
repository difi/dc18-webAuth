Server-side https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Web Authentication] library for
Java. Provides implementations of the
https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#rp-operations[Relying Party operations] required
for a server to support Web Authentication. This includes registering
authenticators and authenticating registered authenticators.

The project is currently implemented mostly in Scala; this is intended to be
translated to Java when the specification and these APIs seem stable enough.


=== Example Usage

See link:webauthn-server-demo[`webauthn-server-demo`] for a complete demo
server, which stores authenticator registrations temporarily in memory.
